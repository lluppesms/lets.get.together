## 🛠️ Developer Setup (Pre-Commit Hooks)

This repo uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to run pre-commit checks automatically before every `git commit`:

- 🔍 **Secret scanning** via [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) — blocks commits containing API keys, tokens, or credentials
- 🎨 **Auto-formatting** via `dotnet format` — fixes C# whitespace/style violations and re-stages the corrected files

### One-time setup

1. **Install gitleaks** (required for secret scanning):
   - Windows: `winget install gitleaks`
   - macOS: `brew install gitleaks`

2. **Run `npm install`** — this activates the Husky hooks automatically via the `prepare` script.

That's it! The hooks run on every commit from then on. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details.

## 🔧 Developer Setup

This repo uses [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) pre-commit hooks to automatically format C# code and scan for secrets before every commit. Two one-time setup steps are required:

### 1. Install gitleaks

The secret scanner must be installed separately on each developer machine:

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| 🪟 **Windows** | `winget install gitleaks` |
| 🍎 **macOS** | `brew install gitleaks` |
| 🐧 **Linux** | See [gitleaks releases](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases) |

> If `gitleaks` is not found, the hook will skip secret scanning with a warning — it won't block your commit.

### 2. Activate Husky hooks

```bash
npm install
```

That's it! The `prepare` script in `package.json` activates the hooks automatically. From this point on, every `git commit` will:

1. 🔍 **Scan for secrets** using gitleaks (skipped gracefully if not installed)
2. 🎨 **Auto-format staged `.cs` files** using `dotnet format` across all solution files
3. ✅ **Re-stage any auto-formatted files** so they're included in your commit

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full contributor guidelines.

## 🤖 GenAI-Powered Features

This application has been supercharged with **Generative AI capabilities** to bring your dad jokes to life:

### 🎨 AI Image Generation
When viewing a joke, the app uses AI to:
1. 📝 **Analyze the joke content** and understand the humor
2. 🖼️ **Generate a visual scene description** that captures the essence of the joke
3. 🎨 **Create an AI-generated image** that illustrates the joke visually (*using the brand new MAI-Image-2 model!*)

Transform text-based dad jokes into visual masterpieces! Each joke can have its own unique, AI-generated illustration that brings the punchline to life.

### 🏷️ Automatic Category Assignment
When creating a **new joke**, the AI assistant works behind the scenes to:
- 🧠 **Analyze the joke content** to understand themes, topics, and humor style
- 🔍 **Intelligently assign relevant categories** automatically
- ⚡ **Save you time** - no manual categorization needed!

Just write your joke, and the AI figures out whether it's a pun, a knock-knock joke, animal humor, food-related, or any other category. It's like having a comedy curator in your pocket!

> **Powered by Azure Foundry** - Because even dad jokes deserve enterprise-grade AI

## 🤖 GitHub Copilot Agents and Skills

All of the GitHub Copilot Agents and Skills that used to live in this repo have relocated to a dedicated repository for better maintenance and discoverability. You could say they... moved to a better *repo-hood*. 🏘️

Check out the [my.copilot.skills](https://github.com/lluppesms/my.copilot.skills) repo to see the full collection of AI agents and skills that can be used in this project.

### Loading in VS Code

Load the [VS Code Workspace](./dadabase.demo.gh.code-workspace) to automatically make all shared skills available to GitHub Copilot Chat. The workspace file includes both this repo and the `my.copilot.skills` repo as workspace folders, so Copilot Chat discovers the skills from `.github/skills/` in both repositories.

### Loading in GitHub Copilot CLI

The CLI is a little different and does not support the VS Code Workspace. For details on loading skills into the GitHub Copilot CLI (and what to do about gents, and instructions), see the [Copilot CLI Skills Guide](./Docs/Copilot_CLI_Skills.md).
